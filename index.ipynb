    "# Electromagnetics with steel cased wells\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains the notebooks used to generate the examples shown in Chapter 5\n",
    "of the thesis [\"Electromagnetic methods for imaging subsurface injections\"](https://github.com/lheagy/phd-thesis) by [Lindsey J. Heagy](https://github.com/lheagy). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, I examine behavior of currents in a time-domain EM experiment over a steel-cased well. I look at the response of a conductive well and a conductive, permeable well. I also consider approximations to conductive permeable wells and discuss the extra complexity that EM introduces as compared to DC resistivity. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online\n",
    "The notebooks can be run online through [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/simpeg-research/heagy-2018-em-casing/master) or [azure notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/simpeg-research/heagy-2018-em-casing).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Locally\n",
    "To run them locally, you will need to have python installed, preferably through [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then clone this reposiroty. From a command line, run\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/simpeg-research/heagy-2018-em-casing.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `cd` into the `heagy-2018-em-casing`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd heagy-2018-em-casing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup your software environment, we recommend you use the provided conda environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "source activate em-casing-environment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "alternatively, you can install dependencies through pypi\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then launch Jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter will then launch in your web-browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell of code can be run with `shift + enter` or you can run the entire notebook by selecting `cell`, `Run All` in the toolbar.\n",
